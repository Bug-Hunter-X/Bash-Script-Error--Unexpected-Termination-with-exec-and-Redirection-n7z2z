# This script attempts to process a file, but it has a subtle error.
# The error lies in how it handles file redirection and the use of the 'exec' command.

file_to_process="data.txt"

# Incorrect usage of exec and file redirection
exec < "$file_to_process" cat > output.txt

# The script should process 'data.txt' and write the output to 'output.txt',
# however, due to the 'exec' command, it replaces the current shell process
# with 'cat', leading to the script terminating prematurely and not creating
# 'output.txt'.

# Further, If data.txt doesn't exist then the command will fail silently

echo "Script finished" # This line will not be reached because of the exec command.
